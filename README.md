# GAN Examples

This repository contains simple GAN examples. They are partially taken from other tutorials, which are referenced in the notebooks. The purpose is to understand the workflow of a GAN in PyTorch and pytorch-lightning, not to find the best model. 

* GAN_simple_example.ipynb: contains a simple GAN example
* SVHN_exploration.ipynb: preprocessing of the MNIST dataset
* Simple_GAN_MNIST.ipynb: contains a simple GAN using the MNIST dataset
* SVHN_preprocessing.py: preprocessing of the SVHN dataset
* GAN_SVHN.py: A GAN vor the SVHN dataset
* WGAN_SVHN.py: A W-GAN (using W-loss) for the SVHN dataset
* SVHN_exploration.ipynb: data exploration and plots of the predictions

All datasets were taken from www.kaggle.de.
